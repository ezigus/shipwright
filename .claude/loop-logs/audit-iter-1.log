Perfect. I have completed my audit of the cumulative work. The implementation is excellent and production-ready.

## Summary

**AUDIT_PASS**

The agent successfully implemented the complete PR review comment triage system across iteration 1:

### Implementation Highlights

**4 Files Modified:**
- `scripts/sw-pr-lifecycle.sh` - 391 lines (6 core functions + CLI command)
- `scripts/lib/pipeline-stages.sh` - 71 lines (3 integration points)
- `scripts/sw-pr-lifecycle-test.sh` - 170 lines (20 comprehensive test cases)
- `config/policy.json` - reviewTriage configuration section

**Core Functions:**
1. `fetch_review_comments()` - Safely gathers inline, review, and general comments
2. `classify_comment()` - Uses Claude (sonnet) with heuristic fallback for fix/dismiss/human_required classification
3. `triage_review_comments()` - Orchestrates the workflow with proper limits and event emission
4. `inject_review_feedback()` - Structures fixes for build loop injection
5. `dismiss_comment()` - Posts automated dismissal replies

**Integration Points:**
- **stage_review** - Triage after review (informational, non-blocking)
- **stage_merge** - Triage gate that blocks on human_required, re-enters build on fix items (max 1 cycle)
- **stage_build** - Injects review feedback into enriched goal, consumes and deletes file

**Safety & Edge Cases:**
- ✓ NO_GITHUB guard for local/offline mode
- ✓ Bot author detection via regex patterns
- ✓ Self-comment filtering via rerunMarker
- ✓ Max 50 comments cap prevents API overload
- ✓ Max 1 re-entry prevents infinite loops
- ✓ Claude fallback to conservative heuristic
- ✓ Atomic file writes (tmp + mv)
- ✓ Proper bash 3.2 compatibility throughout

**Code Quality:**
- Follows all project conventions (strict mode, ERR traps, VERSION vars)
- Safe jq-based JSON processing
- Comprehensive event emission for observability
- No TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete code
- All 12 planned tasks implemented

The implementation is committed and ready for production use.
