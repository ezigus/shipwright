I need to review the cumulative work, but I have significant concerns about what's been delivered. Let me analyze this critically:

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Feature Implementation in Diff**
The diff stat shows NO changes to `scripts/sw-status.sh` (the file where the `--json` flag should be implemented) or `scripts/sw-status-test.sh` (where the tests should exist). Yet the plan claims the feature is fully implemented at lines 57-267. This is a major red flag.

### 2. **Unrelated Changes to Demo Files**
The diff shows significant changes to:
- `demo/package-lock.json` (+4787 lines)
- `demo/src/middleware.js` (+23 lines)

These changes are unrelated to implementing a `--json` flag for `shipwright status`. These appear to be leftover from earlier commits (ac2d055 shows "fix(demo): return 401 instead of 403...").

### 3. **Contradictory Plan Statement**
The plan says: **"No code changes are needed — the pipeline can proceed directly to PR."**

This makes no sense for a BUILD stage of a feature-development pipeline. If the feature was already implemented before this pipeline started, it shouldn't be in the build stage. If it needs to be added, then code changes ARE needed.

### 4. **Test Verification Gap**
The agent claims "All 30 tests pass" in `sw-status-test.sh`, but:
- There are no changes to that test file in the diff
- The actual test report mentions "37 server API tests passed" (from demo)
- Cannot independently verify if `sw-status` feature tests actually exist and pass

### 5. **No Evidence of Feature Completion**
Without seeing changes to the main feature file or test file, I cannot verify that the `--json` flag was actually:
- Implemented in `scripts/sw-status.sh`
- Tested in `scripts/sw-status-test.sh`
- Integrated properly with error handling

## Required Fixes

Before this can be approved:

1. **Verify actual implementation**: Show explicit changes to `scripts/sw-status.sh` with the `--json` flag implementation
2. **Confirm tests exist**: Show changes to `scripts/sw-status-test.sh` with 30 passing tests
3. **Clean up demo changes**: Remove unrelated modifications to `demo/` files
4. **Update plan narrative**: The plan should clearly state what code was added/modified, not claim "no changes needed"
5. **Run feature-specific tests**: Explicitly run and report on `scripts/sw-status-test.sh` (not just the demo server tests)

The work as currently presented does not convincingly demonstrate that the feature has been successfully implemented.
