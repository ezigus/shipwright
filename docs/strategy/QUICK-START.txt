SHIPWRIGHT GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY - EXECUTIVE BRIEF
================================================================================

CREATED: February 14, 2026
STATUS: Ready for implementation
OWNER: Seth Ford

================================================================================
CORE VALUE PROPOSITION
================================================================================

"Ship code 10x faster with autonomous Claude Code agent teams — no AI API 
vendor lock-in, runs on your infra, integrates with your GitHub."

================================================================================
KEY DIFFERENTIATORS
================================================================================

1. Self-hosted + Open Source (No vendor lock-in)
2. Agent Team Orchestration (Multi-agent coordination)
3. Native GitHub Integration (Checks, Deployments APIs)
4. Built-in Intelligence (Predictive risk, DORA metrics)
5. Cost Transparency (Per-pipeline ROI tracking)
6. Universal Bash Compatibility (Runs anywhere)

================================================================================
DISTRIBUTION MODEL (3-TIER)
================================================================================

Q1-Q2: Community Edition (Free, Unlimited)
  └─ Open source on GitHub, organic growth via Hacker News + Product Hunt
  
Q3:    Freemium SaaS (Optional Hosted)
  └─ $49/mo individuals, $299/mo teams, free tier for OSS
  
Q4+:   Enterprise Edition (Self-Hosted + Support)
  └─ $5K-$50K/year, SAML/OIDC, SOC 2, SLA

================================================================================
4-PHASE ROADMAP
================================================================================

  Success: 5K GitHub stars, 70% using predictive risk
  
Phase 3: ENTERPRISE READY (Apr-Jun, 12 weeks)
  Goal: Unlock $100K+ deals
  Focus: Auth, compliance, GitHub App
  Success: SOC 2 certified, 5+ enterprise pilots
  
Phase 4: PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM (Jun+, Ongoing)

================================================================================
COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
================================================================================

Shipwright's Unique Quadrant:
  Open-source + Self-hosted + Multi-agent Orchestration

vs. Cursor:           ✓ Autonomous execution (Cursor is IDE-only)
vs. Copilot:          ✓ Self-hosted + cost transparency
vs. GitHub Actions:   ✓ AI-native agent orchestration
vs. Traditional CI:   ✓ Zero human-in-loop execution

Market Tailwinds:
  • Enterprise skepticism of AI SaaS (prefer self-hosted)
  • Agent craze (Shipwright is native, not bolted-on)
  • Cost consciousness (Shipwright tracks ROI)
  • DevOps evolution (delivery acceleration = competitive advantage)
  • Open-source preference (trust for critical infrastructure)

================================================================================
ADOPTION FUNNEL
================================================================================

Stage 1: AWARENESS (GitHub Trending, HN, Product Hunt)
  → Technical decision-makers, DevOps leads
  
Stage 2: TRIAL (One-liner install, 5-min first pipeline)
  → Curious developers
  
Stage 3: CONVERSION (Daemon running autonomously 7+ days)
  → Dev teams processing 5+ issues/sprint
  
Stage 4: EXPANSION (Fleet, integrations, enterprise)
  → Multi-repo orgs, enterprises

Conversion Target: 40% of trial users → daemon adoption at 7 days

================================================================================
KEY MESSAGING BY AUDIENCE
================================================================================

Developers:
  "Ship code 10x faster"
  "From issue to PR in 4 minutes"
  "No vendor lock-in"

Dev Teams:
  "Reduce DORA lead time 80%"
  "Stop manual shipping"
  "Transparent costs"

Enterprises:
  "AI-native without lock-in"
  "SOC 2, HIPAA-ready"
  "Reduces release cycles from weeks to days"

================================================================================
PARTNERSHIPS (PRIORITY ORDER)
================================================================================

Tier 1: Anthropic (Co-marketing, "Built with Claude Code")
Tier 2: GitHub (Native integration, marketplace)
Tier 3: Atlassian (Jira sync), Slack, PagerDuty
Tier 4: CNCF, dev communities, conference speaking

================================================================================
RISK MITIGATION
================================================================================

Risk: Anthropic API pricing changes
  → Multi-model support from day 1 (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, open models)

Risk: Competitors catch up
  → Move fast on agent orchestration (get to 10K deployments first)
  → Build community moat (switching cost high at 1K+ developers)

Risk: Adoption plateaus
  → Enterprise tier unlocks revenue even if community plateaus
  → Partnership amplification (Anthropic, GitHub, DevOps platforms)

Risk: Team spread thin on SaaS
  → Keep OSS on critical path, SaaS as optional extension
  → Hire dedicated SaaS team in Phase 3

================================================================================
